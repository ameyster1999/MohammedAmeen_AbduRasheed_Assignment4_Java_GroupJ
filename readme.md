# Student Record Management System

## Overview

This Java program is designed for managing student records. It allows users to perform various operations on student data, such as adding new students, updating existing records, and displaying information. The system utilizes object-oriented programming concepts and fundamental Java features.

## Features

1. **Student Class:**
    - Attributes:
        - Student ID (unique for each student)
        - First Name
        - Last Name
        - Date of Birth (in the format "YYYY-MM-DD")
        - GPA (Grade Point Average)

2. **Menu System:**
    - Implement a menu system that allows users to choose from the following options:
        1. Add a new student record
        2. Update an existing student record
        3. Display all student records
        4. Search for a student by ID
        5. Calculate and display the average GPA of all students
        6. Exit the program

3. **Data Storage:**
    - Student records are stored in an ArrayList.

4. **Input Validation:**
    - User input is validated to ensure it meets the required format (e.g., valid date format, GPA within a specified range).

5. **Error Handling:**
    - Graceful error handling is implemented to handle invalid input, with informative error messages provided to the user.

6. **Documentation:**
    - The code includes comments and documentation to explain the purpose of classes, methods, and significant code blocks.
